# Moon Viewing Calendar
I conceived this idea when I was wondering when I might observe a full moon in the sky in the middle of the day. The internet did not provide an easy answer. And I wanted a calendar that I could hang on my wall and have handy as a quick reference guide for when I might see the moon that day. So, I drew out a sketch for the kind of chart that might serve this purpose (included my original sketch here). I tried using sun and moon rise data from various sources, but eventually I found an astronomy library for python (astropy) that I used for the final chart. This instance charts the moon viewing calendar for Portland, Oregon, but any latitude, longitude can easily be used as input to the final function.
